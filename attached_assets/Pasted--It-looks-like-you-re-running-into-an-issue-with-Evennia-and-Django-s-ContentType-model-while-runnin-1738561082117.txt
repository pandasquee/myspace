It looks like you're running into an issue with Evennia and Django's ContentType model while running your tests. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. Apply Migrations
The error suggests that the ContentType table might not be populated correctly. Run the following commands inside your Evennia environment:

sh
Copy
Edit
evennia migrate
If you are using a virtual environment, make sure you activate it first.

Alternatively, if running Django directly:

sh
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
This ensures that all Django apps, including contenttypes, have the correct database schema.

2. Check If ContentTypes Are Populated
After running migrations, check whether the ContentType table has entries:

sh
Copy
Edit
python manage.py shell
Then run:

python
Copy
Edit
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
ContentType.objects.all()
If it returns an empty list, your migrations might not have run correctly.

3. Rebuild the Database (If Needed)
If the above doesn't work and you are in development, try resetting your database:

sh
Copy
Edit
evennia reset
If using Django directly:

sh
Copy
Edit
python manage.py flush
python manage.py migrate
⚠ WARNING: This will delete all data in your database, so only do this if you’re sure you don’t need the existing data.

4. Check for Deprecation Warning (index_together)
You're also seeing this warning:

csharp
Copy
Edit
'index_together' is deprecated. Use 'Meta.indexes' in 'typeclasses.Tag' instead.
If typeclasses.Tag is a custom model in your Evennia setup, check its Meta class inside typeclasses/tag.py or wherever it’s defined.

Old (deprecated) way:

python
Copy
Edit
class Meta:
    index_together = [["field1", "field2"]]
New way (Django 5+ compatible):

python
Copy
Edit
from django.db import models

class Meta:
    indexes = [models.Index(fields=["field1", "field2"])]
Modify this if necessary and restart the server.

5. Check for Evennia Updates
Since you’re running Evennia, it’s possible that you're using an outdated version incompatible with your Django version. Check if an update is available:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade evennia
6. Reinstall Dependencies
If the issue persists, try reinstalling your dependencies:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
7. Ensure You’re Running in the Correct Environment
If you have multiple Python environments, ensure you're running in the right one:

sh
Copy
Edit
which python
which evennia
If needed, activate the correct virtual environment:

sh
Copy
Edit
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
8. Restart Everything
After trying the above steps, restart your Evennia server:

sh
Copy
Edit
evennia stop
evennia start
And retry your tests.

Final Note
If you’re still seeing ContentType matching query does not exist, your database may be corrupted. You might need to manually delete and recreate it.

sh
Copy
Edit
rm db.sqlite3  # Or drop PostgreSQL tables if using PostGIS
evennia migrate
