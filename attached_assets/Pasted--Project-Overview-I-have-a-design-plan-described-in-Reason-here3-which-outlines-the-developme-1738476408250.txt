**Project Overview:**
I have a design plan described in “Reason here3,” which outlines the development of a space-themed system using Evennia-like structures. Specifically, I need the following:
1. A Python project setup.
2. All required dependencies installed (including Evennia, although we will not run it).
3. A “spaceobject.py” file containing the SpaceObject class.
4. A “manager.py” file containing logic to manage SpaceObjects (the “manager code”).
5. Placeholder command classes in separate files (e.g., “helm.py,” “engineering.py,” etc.) with commented explanations.
6. Organization files (e.g., “federation.py,” etc.) with commented explanations.
7. Comments in code explaining how everything would fit together or be used, but no actual running or testing of Evennia.
8. Stop after the setup and file creation (do not run or try to start an Evennia server).

**Detailed Steps and Instructions:**

1. **Create a new Python project** (if not already done).

2. **Install necessary dependencies**:
   - Install Evennia and any other dependencies required to demonstrate or stub out the basic structure (e.g., `pip install evennia`). 
   - Note: We understand Evennia may not fully run here, but we want the environment set up for potential usage.

3. **File Creation and Content**:
   - **spaceobject.py**:  
     - Create a `SpaceObject` class.  
     - Add docstrings or inline comments explaining the purpose of `SpaceObject`, such as modeling ships, stations, etc.
   
   - **manager.py**:  
     - Create a Manager class or set of functions that manage or track `SpaceObject` instances.  
     - Include inline comments describing how this manager interacts with `SpaceObject` and other parts of the system.
   
   - **commands/** directory (create a folder named `commands`):  
     - **helm.py**: Stub out a `HelmCommand` class (or similarly named class) with comments explaining how it would be used to control navigation.  
     - **engineering.py**: Stub out an `EngineeringCommand` class (or similarly named class) with comments explaining how it would handle maintenance, repairs, etc.  
     - (Feel free to add more command files if desired—just leave them as placeholders with comments about intended functionality.)
   
   - **organization/** directory (create a folder named `organization`):
     - **federation.py**: Stub out a `Federation` class or module that could represent an in-game organization. Include comments describing how it interacts with `SpaceObject` and the commands.  
     - (Similarly, create more organization files if necessary, each containing placeholder classes and explanatory comments.)

   - Throughout **all** files, ensure there are **commented notes** explaining the functionality, how classes would be used, and their relationship to one another.

4. **Do not attempt to run or configure Evennia** beyond installing it. We are only setting up the environment and creating the basic Python files. **Stop after everything is installed and the files are created.**

5. **Final Note**: The goal is just to install dependencies and create the file structure with placeholders and explanatory comments. **Do not run or start Evennia.** Stop once the setup and file creation is complete.

**Confirmation:**
- Please confirm the successful creation of the structure, installation of Evennia, and stop without attempting to run it.
