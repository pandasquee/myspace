ERROR: No Evennia settings file was found. Evennia looks for the
    file in your game directory as ./server/conf/settings.py.

    You must run this command from somewhere inside a valid game
    directory first created with

        evennia --init mygamename

    If you are in a game directory but is missing a settings.py file,
    it may be because you have git-cloned an existing game directory.
    The settings.py file is not cloned by git (it's in .gitignore)
    since it can contain sensitive and/or server-specific information.
    You can create a new, empty settings file with

        evennia --initsettings

    If cloning the settings file is not a problem you could manually
    copy over the old settings file or remove its entry in .gitignore
