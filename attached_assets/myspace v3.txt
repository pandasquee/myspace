Key Enhancements
1. Type Safety & Data Validation
* Uses Python type hints for clear function interfaces.
* Validates all data upon deserialization, ensuring all required fields are present.
* Custom DeserializationError exception for debugging.
* Graceful fallbacks to default values to prevent system crashes.
* Ensures relationships between attributes remain consistent.
2. Advanced Power Allocation & Subsystem Prioritization
* Main, Auxiliary, and Battery Power Pools
   * Ships have a dedicated power management system.
   * Power is dynamically allocated across subsystems.
   * If a subsystem has no allocated power, it remains non-operational.
* Proportional Distribution System
   * When power is low, systems receive proportional power rather than failing outright.
   * Tactical power (weapons/shields) has priority in combat.
* Fuel Efficiency & Stealth Mechanics
   * Lower reactor output conserves fuel.
   * Running at lower output makes the ship harder to detect via LRS scans.
3. Combat Mechanics & Shield Facing System
* Shields Are Divided Into Six Facings:
   * Front, Rear, Port, Starboard, Dorsal, Ventral.
   * Each facing has independent power allocation.
* Beam & Missile Weapons:
   * Beam weapons fire within a defined firing arc.
   * Missiles can be targeted at any facing, but require tracking time.
* Damage Model:
   * Damage is distributed across shield facings.
   * When shields collapse, damage transfers to the hull.
4. Electronic Warfare (ECM/ECCM) & Advanced Sensor Mechanics
Sensor Types:
* Short-Range Sensors (SRS): Active within a single sector.
* Long-Range Sensors (LRS): Can detect objects across multiple sectors.
* Focused Scans: Concentrate sensor energy on a single object.
* Electronic Warfare (ECM/ECCM): Ships can attempt to jam sensors or counter-jamming efforts.
LRS Detection Model Based on Resolution:
Detection Level
	Distance (Sectors)
	Information Gained
	No Detection
	Beyond range
	Nothing detected
	Faint Signal
	6-10 sectors away
	A blip on sensors
	Basic Contact
	3-6 sectors away
	Object detected; size estimated
	Partial Profile
	1-3 sectors away
	Ship class, speed, heading
	Full Profile
	Within 1 sector
	Full ship details, power levels
	Probabilistic Sensor Returns:
Detection is determined by:
* Sensor Power vs. Distance Squared.
* ECM Penalty (reduces accuracy).
* Resolution Setting (low-power scans detect more objects but with less detail).
Formula for Detection Probability:
Pdetection = Sensor Power / (Distance^2 + ECM Penalty)


* If P > Threshold, the ship is detected.
* Otherwise, detection is uncertain or incomplete.
5. Game Ticker & Update Priority
* High-Priority Events:
   * Combat actions, sensor detection updates, and subsystem failures.
* Lower-Priority Events:
   * Background sensor sweeps, long-term travel, and passive power draw.
* Batch Processing:
   * Multiple updates processed together, reducing system strain.
6. Database Schema for Real-Time Sensor Data
Example PostgreSQL Table for Sensor Contacts
CREATE TABLE sensor_contacts (
    ship_id INT REFERENCES spaceobjects(id),
    contact_id INT REFERENCES spaceobjects(id),
    detection_level FLOAT,
    distance FLOAT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);


* Stores detection levels & distances of sensor scans.
* Efficient query system for real-time sensor tracking.
