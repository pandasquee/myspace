Sector → SpaceObject → Neighborhood → Room Hierarchy
Your game's spatial organization follows a hierarchical system that ensures both large-scale space navigation and local movement within space stations, starships, and planets.

1. Master "Universe" Room
All SpaceObjects (ships, stations, planets, anomalies) exist inside a single "Universe" room.
SpaceObjects never leave the Universe room unless they dock or land.
SpaceObjects are positioned using coordinate tracking rather than physical room movement.
2. SpaceObjects
SpaceObjects include ships, stations, planets, and any other large spatial entity.
They move inside the "Universe" room, but their internal rooms are separate spaces.
Each SpaceObject tracks its sector and coordinate position within the Universe.
3. Neighborhoods
Some SpaceObjects (like space stations or large ships) might have multiple internal neighborhoods.
A neighborhood represents a section within a SpaceObject, such as:
Decks on a starship.
Districts on a space station.
Sectors of a planetary city.
Neighborhoods help organize larger SpaceObjects, reducing complexity in movement.
4. Rooms
Characters and interactive game elements exist inside Rooms.
Rooms belong to a SpaceObject and define specific areas inside the ship/station/planet.
Each room is linked by exits (doors, corridors, airlocks).
Movement and Docking/Landing Mechanics
SpaceObjects Move Within the Universe Room

Ships travel at warp/impulse within the Universe room using coordinate-based movement.
They do not physically "move" between different Evennia rooms.
Docking & Landing Mechanics

When a SpaceObject docks or lands at another:
The entire SpaceObject is teleported inside the larger SpaceObject.
An airlock exit is created connecting the docked ship to the landing/docking point.
The docked ship's position is now inside the larger SpaceObject, instead of the Universe room.
Undocking & Launching Mechanics

When a SpaceObject undocks or takes off:
It teleports back to the Universe room.
The airlock exit is removed.
The ship resumes normal space movement.
Example: Ship Docking at a Station
A player is aboard USS Endeavor (a SpaceObject inside the Universe room).
The USS Endeavor docks at Deep Space 9 (another SpaceObject).
USS Endeavor is teleported inside DS9.
A new airlock exit connects the ship's entryway to DS9's docking bay.
Players can walk freely between the ship and the station.
If the ship undocks, it is teleported back to the Universe room, and the exit is removed.
Why This Works Well
✅ Preserves coordinate-based movement without physically moving ships between rooms.
✅ Allows for docking mechanics that feel natural.
✅ Keeps internal spaces independent from the larger space navigation system.
✅ Scales efficiently—no need to create separate "space rooms" for every possible ship movement.
