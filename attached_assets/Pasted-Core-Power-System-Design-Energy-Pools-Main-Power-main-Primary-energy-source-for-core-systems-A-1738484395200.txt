Core Power System Design
Energy Pools

Main Power (main) – Primary energy source for core systems.
Auxiliary Power (aux) – Secondary power, used for backup and less critical systems.
Battery Power (batt) – Stored energy, used when main/aux power is insufficient.
Power Generation & Allocation

Each ship generates 10% of its total energy pool as available power per cycle.
Example: A ship with 3000GW main power and 300GW aux/batt generates:
300GW of main power
30GW of auxiliary power
30GW of battery power
The Power Manager dynamically distributes power to subsystems:
Helm (Propulsion)
Shields
Weapons
Sensors
Operations (Life Support, Comms, Transporters, etc.)
Unallocated power is automatically distributed based on priority.
Power Usage & Balancing
Dynamic Allocation: The system ensures that when power is available, it is assigned to active subsystems based on predefined priorities.
Subsystem Cutoff: If a system has no allocated power, it stops functioning or operates at reduced efficiency.
Power Scaling: Subsystems can operate at partial efficiency if power is limited.
Fuel Efficiency & Reactor Output
Reactors operate at a percentage of maximum output:
Example: A ship’s reactor can be set to 23%, 4%, etc.
Lower reactor output = Lower power generation, reducing energy for ship systems.
Lower reactor output = Lower sensor visibility, creating a stealth mechanic.
Lower reactor output = Higher fuel efficiency, allowing for longer voyages.
Additional Features
No Passive Power Regeneration: Power is continuously generated as long as fuel is available.
Tactical Adjustments: Players can dial back main power to conserve fuel while affecting sensor resolution and system performance.
Comparison to Traditional Systems
Similar to C-based space_balance.c, where power distribution is dynamic and proportional.
Inspired by Star Trek's power balancing, allowing players to reroute power in emergencies.
Unlike many games, there is no “energy cap” that must recharge over time—power is always dynamically managed.
