Sectors Management System Overview
Your Evennia-based space game uses a sector-based spatial partitioning system to efficiently manage ship movement, sensors, and interactions in space. Below is a detailed breakdown of the system's key components and mechanics.

1. Spatial Hierarchy
Your game's space is organized into a hierarchical structure:

Space Units (SU) ‚Äì The base unit of measurement for precise location tracking.
Parsecs (PC) ‚Äì A larger unit used to group Space Units into a structured galactic map.
Sectors ‚Äì The fundamental partition of space, each spanning 10√ó10 parsecs.
Quadrants ‚Äì Larger zones inspired by Star Trek, grouping multiple sectors.
Galaxy ‚Äì The entire playable universe, composed of infinite sectors.
2. Sector Structure
Each sector is a fixed 10√ó10 parsec area, with a flattened Z-axis beyond ¬±500 parsecs. This means:

Sectors extend infinitely in the X-Y plane.
The Z-axis is capped at ¬±500 parsecs for gameplay purposes.
The Galactic Center (0,0) serves as a reference point.
Sectors are identified using a naming system:

Example: G-3.5 represents a sector in the Gamma Quadrant, located at (3,5).
3. Location and Positioning
Ships track positions in SU (Space Units).
Sector IDs are assigned based on parsec-scale coordinates.
Each sector has a hard border‚Äîships transition between sectors when their position crosses a sector boundary.
4. Sensors and Scanning System
Short-Range Sensors (SRS)
Work within a single sector.
Provide detailed ship scans, including heading, speed, power, and weapons.
Are continuous but can be blocked by cloaking, ECM, or environmental factors.
Long-Range Sensors (LRS)
Detect ships across multiple sectors.
Provide position, speed, and heading but with limited details.
Can scan a limited number of sectors based on performance constraints.
Are affected by stealth, ECM, and distance.
Binary Detection Model
Ships are either detected or not (probability-based).
LRS may lose contact due to movement or interference.
Active scans reveal the scanning ship‚Äôs position.
5. Sector Updates & Real-Time Processing
Your system processes multiple active sectors simultaneously:

Ships in active sectors are updated in real-time.
Inactive sectors do not update until they are activated (e.g., by ship entry).
The sector list dynamically manages active sectors, ensuring performance efficiency.
6. Movement Mechanics
Ships transition sectors automatically when moving across sector borders.
Intra-sector movement is continuous, with positions stored in SU.
Warp speeds impact sector transitions, requiring efficient position updates.
7. Performance Optimizations
Sector-based partitioning reduces the number of ships checked for interactions.
SRS updates only ships in the same sector.
LRS updates occur at lower frequencies to balance detail and performance.
Conclusion
Your sector-based space management system provides: ‚úî Scalable space partitioning for an infinite universe.
‚úî Efficient real-time movement and interactions.
‚úî Sector-based sensor mechanics to reduce processing load.
‚úî Binary detection for ships, supporting ECM, cloaking, and stealth tactics.
‚úî Multi-sector active processing for real-time combat and exploration.

Sector & Full SU Coordinates for Earth (Terra)
Sector Calculation (PC-based)
Earth's Parsecs (PC) Coordinates:

X: -9174.044174 PC
Y: 61.8 PC
Z: 0 PC
Sectors are 10√ó10 parsecs

Sector numbering starts from (0,0) outward, meaning Earth's sector is:
Sector: A-917.4.6

Full Space Unit (SU) Coordinates for Earth
Since 1 parsec = 3,085,659,622.014257 SU, we calculate:

X (SU) = -9174.044174 PC √ó 3,085,659,622.014257 SU/PC
X (SU) ‚âà -28,314,645,443,006.17 SU

Y (SU) = 61.8 PC √ó 3,085,659,622.014257 SU/PC

Z (SU) = 0 PC √ó 3,085,659,622.014257 SU/PC
Z (SU) = 0 SU

Key Takeaways
Earth's location is stored in full SU precision:
(-28.3 trillion, 190 billion, 0) SU
For system readability, it's converted to PC and placed in a sector:
Sector A-917.4.6
The SU system maintains extreme precision, but using parsecs makes it manageable for players and UI readability.
This reinforces your approach: Space Units (SU) store exact positions, but Parsecs (PC) and Sectors provide human-readable organization. üöÄ
